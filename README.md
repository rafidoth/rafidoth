Hello there! I'm Rafi, a passionate Computer Science undergraduate student with a strong interest in application development. 

I have a passion for arts and design, but creating them doesn't come naturally to me. Similarly, I find great beauty in mathematics, even though I'm not a proficient mathematician. Programming is my only way to see both xD.
